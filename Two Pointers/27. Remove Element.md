```java
class Solution {
    public int removeElement(int[] nums, int val) {
        // define two pointers
        int slow = 0;
        int fast = 0;
        // start to traverse all elements in int[] nums
        while(fast < nums.length){
            if(nums[fast] != val){
                nums[slow++] = nums[fast++];
            }else{
                fast++;
            }
        }
        return slow;
        
    }
}


```

+ It is important to figure out the physical meaning of fast and slow pointer:
    - slow: all the elements before it (not including itself) are all elements that should be kept after processing. 
    - fast: the next element that is going to be processed
+ At the very beginning, you may not sure whether it should be [0,slow] or [0,slow). My thought is: when we define those two pointers, we give them the default value 0.However, at that time, we have no idea whether we should keep nums[0] or not, which means nums[slow] should not included,therefore, [0,slow) is the answer.
+ Similarly, fast means that one that is going to be processed, not the one just processed. It is consistent with our 1st step - giving 'fast' the inital value 0. When we do 'fast = 0', we are just about to process nums[0].

+ Complexity analysis: 
    - Time complexity: O(n) where n is the length of array nums;
    - Space complexity： O（1）： in-place operation
