```java
class Solution {
    public ListNode swapPairs(ListNode head) {
        //corner case
        if(head == null || head.next == null){
            return head;
        }
        ListNode newNode = swapPairs(head.next.next);
        ListNode newHead = head.next;// Node2
        head.next.next = head;
        head.next = newNode;
        return newHead;
        
    }
}

```

+ This is the first time that I feel Recursion is so powerful. I did not mean to use recursion but it just occurred to me. 
+ Having done ' Reverse a linked list' made me feel that this question is very similar. One imporant note is that we need to record the 2nd node (newHead) because when the swap is done, the original head won't be the head any longer. And in 'Reverse a linked list', the newHead is generated by recursion. In this question, it's a different story. 
- E.g.   1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6

```java
swapPairs(head.next.next);   //1 -> 2  4 ->3 -> 6 ->5, also, **2 still points to 3!**, newNode = 4
ListNode newHead = head.next;  // record Node '2'
head.next.next = head; //    2 -> 1  4 ->3 -> 6 ->5, so that 2 does not point to 3 any longer.
head.next = newNode; // 2 -> 1 ->  4 ->3 -> 6 ->5
return newHead; // return Node '2'.
