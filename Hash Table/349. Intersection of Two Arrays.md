+ Example: [1,2,2,1] and [2,2], the output is [2] rather than [2,2],therefore we need to do deduplicate and **Set** is needed; 
+ The original problem does not define the range of the array value, and under that circumstance, array is not appropriate because we do not know the size. 
+ When array is not a good option:
    - The range of array value is not defined, like in this question originally.
    - The value is very large
    - The values maybe not that large but are distributed sparsely, e.g. 5,10, 10million. We still need to use a 10million size array and it's a waste of space.
+ Now the conditions of this question is updated and the value range is defined, then using array is better than a set.

+ **Action** needed: Compare complexity between Set and array
